WIP. 
This is a game engine that I`m building with C++ and OpenGL.

To run on linux or WSL:
1)cd into build folder \n
2)cmake .. \n
3)make && ./engine \n

If you are running in Visual Studio make sure to configure the build folder correctly (I believe its root by default).

I have just finished the basics of OpenGL and am currently learning how to do lighting:
