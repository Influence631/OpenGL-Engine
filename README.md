WIP. 
This is a game engine buing built with C++ and OpenGL.

To run on linux or WSL:
1. cd into build folder  
2. cmake ..  
3. make && ./engine   

### Visual Studio
If you are using Visual Studio with the CMake integration, make sure to set the working directory to the `build/` folder (not the project root).  
By default, Visual Studio may try to run from the project root, which will cause issues finding compiled binaries.  


I have just finished the basics of OpenGL and am currently learning how to do lighting:
